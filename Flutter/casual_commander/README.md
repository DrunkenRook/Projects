# casual_commander

Current State:
Casual Commander is in a place where you can do all of the base functions, search for cards and search the rules, neither of which require save data. The only place that is currently non-functional in the way it should be is the deck library. The deck library works as intended and signing in will allow the user to save decks to their account, the only issue is that I have been unable to get firebase to work properly and as such, save data is still instanced. Other than that the program works as intended.

Future State:
In the future I would like to implement a few things, aside from the obvious(firebase). Firstly I would like to use an api to pull images for cards when the user enters the card details page. Secondly I would like to implement a commander health counter with lots of variability for health pools, poison counters, etc.. Another thing I noticed that is quite small is that I would like to implement the deletion of decks, as currently a deck that is made permanent. Perhaps I could also add a toggle on decks upon creation to make them publicly or privately saved so that users may share their decks with others.
